\begin{rSubsection}{Brain and Physiological data use for Human Computer Interaction}{ }{ }{ }
\vspace{-5 mm}

I am a multidisciplinary researcher based in the Mixed Reality Lab at the University of Nottingham, UK. As a result of the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training PhD, my research is uniquely placed, sitting between Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Brain Computer Interfaces. 

In 2017 I have secured the prestigious EPSRC Doctoral Prize Award which has offered me the support for my 2-years proposed research agenda based in the Mixed Reality Laboratory at the University of Nottingham. The Prize is an opportunity for the most outstanding EPSRC-funded PhD graduates to receive up to two years of additional support following their PhD and kick start their own independent research career. Subjects covered include Science, Engineering, Technology and Medicine within the EPSRC remit.

 The winning project, \textit{Brain-Tracker: A fit-bit for the Brain based on physiological sensors, tracking the mental workload of everyday tasks} explores the scientific grounding for an inevitable future technology: a Mental Fitbit (MFB) for the Brain.

%My research lies in the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), and Human Factors. I am looking into the integration of non-invasive brain and physiological sensors, such as functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), in the field of HCI. More specifically, I am interested in how we can use such devices to sense physiological responses to human cognition and mental workload, and use this continuous, quantitative measure, as an additional channel of information about the user during interaction.
