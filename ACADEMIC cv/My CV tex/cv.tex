\begin{rSubsection}{Brain and Physiological data use for Human Computer Interaction}{ }{ }{ }
\vspace{-5 mm}
My research lies in the intersection between Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), and Human Factors. I am looking into the integration of non-invasive brain and physiological sensors, such as functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), in the field of HCI. More specifically, I am interested in how we can use such devices to sense physiological responses to human cognition and mental workload, and use this continuous, quantitative measure, as an additional channel of information about the user during interaction.


\begin{itemize}
	\item I have previously \textbf{presented} at CHI 2016, NeuroErgonomics 2016, CHI 2015, CHIPLAY 2015, 2FNIRS 2015, CHI 2014, IEEE RAS 2014, EHF 2014.
	\vspace{-2mm}
	\item Often involved in the Review process for multiple conferences and journals - I have been awarded the \textbf{Excellent Reviewer Award} at ACM-CHI 2017 - I have reviewed for UIST 2017, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, CHI-PLAY 2017, ACM-CHI 2016 (\textbf{Senior Reviewer} for LBW), UIST 2016, ACM-CHI 2015, ACM-CHIPLAY 2014, IEEE CASE 2014, and IIiX 2014.
	\vspace{-2mm}
	\item Always involved into organising Academic Conferences - I am the \textbf{Associate Chair} for Courses at the ACM-CHI 2018 where I have previously acted as a Student Volunteer in 2016 and 2017.
